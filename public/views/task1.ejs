    <p class="lead">Scottish Athletics is running trials for 400 metre athletes. There are four groups of eight
      athletes. The runners run two separate laps and their times are recorded as they complete each of the two laps.
      Any runner who completes either of the two laps in under 50 seconds progresses to the next stage of selection. The
      runner from each of the groups with the fastest lap will receive a medal of commendation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your task is:</p>

    <p>to write a program for one of the groups of female runners find the runners who will progress to the next stage
      find the runner with the fastest lap</p>

    <p>Save this information to a file. You can assume that no two runners have the same name.</p>

    <p>The program requires the following inputs: </p>

    <p>a valid number of runners the first and second name of each runner the time taken to run the first lap the time
      taken to run the second lap </p>

    <p>The output from the program should display the fastest runner, each runnerâ€™s name and indicate whether they will
      progress to the next stage of selection.</p>
